The base looks slick too, and I love the magnetic dock. No more coming into the office in the morning to an uncharged headset because I didn't seat it in the charger properly the night before.\",\n",

I use them a ton and they are very reliable.',\n",

       " 'I bought this upgrade when my CS70N headset battery went dead and would no longer hold a charge. I had the previous model for about 1.5 yrs before it went dead (which sucks), but it is what it is. Customer service offered to replace the my CS70N headset for $56 if I shipped them the defective product, but there was no guarantee my docking station was not also defective, so I opted to just replace all components to a new model.The docking base on the CS530 looks really nice with a shiny piano black finish. Only took about 20 minutes for initial charge to use. I also had the HL10 handset lifter already from the previous model (which is compatible with CS500 series models), so everything plugged in nicely.What I really like about this new model is the charging port. On the CS70N, if you didn\\'t wedge the headset down into the charging cradle tight enough or weren\\'t paying attention to the charge indicator light, you might come into work the next day and find the battery dead. With the CS530 (and I presume all CS500 models), the headset rests comfortably without force into the charging cradle, and it \"feels\" like there\\'s mild magnetic connection to hold the headset in place to ensure it\\'s positioned correctly at all times to pull a solid consistent charge.I don\\'t steer far away from my desk, so I can\\'t speak to the range on this upgrade, but audio quality sounds a little better with this model as well.',\n",
       " 'Comfortable, flexible, great volume control and clarity. The only con...you have to purchase the handset lifter extra, which is $50.',\n",

The magnetic base is a little tricky to get to attach each time, but otherwise it works great.  I wear glasses, and it\\'s not the best fit but works fine.  I\\'m able to stick it in my ear quickly when I get a call.  You press a button on the side of the unit to turn it on, then you press the \"headset\" button on your phone, and then you get the dial tone in your ear.  But call quality is great both when speaking and listening.  I love this thing and everyone should have these at work!!!',\n",

I forget I have it on most of the time. I work in a reasonable sized office (5000 sqft) and haven't had any problems with connectivity while on a call and walking to the printer or another part of the office. Very glad I purchased this item! I would recommend the hookswitch as an add on because it makes taking/making a call so much more convenient.\",\n",

Light weight on my ear, easy to adjust boom, and super simple set up.  My only complaint is when changing the ear mold, it is really difficult to switch them out.  Maybe its just me?',\n",
       " 'Lightweight, very easy to assemble the entire unit. We are extremely pleased with this product and our choice. Very clear crisp line I praise this ear piece! The base unit has lights that really do help to know if your ear piece is charged or charging. It also lights up when in use. I also purchased hand lifter to answer calls away from my desk. I cannot praise this product enough. We also saved by purchasing amazon.com and bought 2 for the price of 1. *************',\n",
       " 'This headset is great!  I recently had my IT department order one of these for me at work and I use it on average between 4 and 6 hours a day.  This headset rocks.  The quality talking on it is great, never a problem hearing the person on the other end, and it works hundreds of feet away from my desk so I can answer calls and talk on the phone from the warehouse or the kitchen.  The battery on the headset is what I need it to be, it never runs out during the day.  I have worked in telemarketing before, so I have used lots of headsets, this one is hands down GREAT!',\n",
       " \"I purchased this headset to replace my old Plantronics CS70 headset which has been my workhorse for the past 8 years. The battery finally died on the headset and it was put to rest with all suitable reverence.  I used the lifter that I bought with my old unit and it works just as well with the new one so if you are replacing the old CS70 and you already have the lifter there is no need to purchase a new one.The fit of this unit is exactly the same as the old one and to me is extremely comfortable so I happen to like the fit.  I also think the unit is quite handsome.  The old CS70 was beginning to look a little dated but this system has a really nice modern design which I also like.Fit and aesthetics aside, the real meat and potatoes is whether it works the way its supposed to.  You can have the best fitting, eye catching piece of equipment in the world but if it doesn't work, it's worthless.First let me say I use this in my office at work and after little trial and error I got it work, the connectors are different than my old model but to say it was a problem to set up would be an overstatement.  There is also a 1800 number you can call, which I did, to set up the volumes, this was a breeze.  I don't stray too far from my desk, maybe 30 feet max and the sound quality was just as good as if I was right next to base station.  I get no feedback or screeching as others have reported, and maybe due to their phone systems.  My voice is transmitted crystal clear as are the voices with those I speak.It's safe to say I'm a fan of Plantronics, I also use their Bluetooth headset for my cellphone and I've been fortunate that I have never experienced any problems with either product.I'm very satisfied with this product and I'm looking forward to many years of great performance from it.\",\n",

The earpiece is quite comfortable, docking it into the charger is easy, and setup was simple.  I haven't tested the battery or range too much yet, but so far so good.  I would definitely recommend this headset.\",\n",

It has some pretty amazing range ( I would guess about 80 to 100 feet, office staff can walk all the way from the front reception area to the back kitchen before it starts cutting out ).  The ear piece is made of soft neoprene/plastic that is comfortable and there are several different options for the ear piece to fit different ears.  Operation is simple and with the following cable we were able to utilize the headset to pickup a call without a handset lifter.  Charge lasts all day ( 8 hour plus shift ).Here is a link to the HookSwitch cable we needed for a Polycom HD650 phone ( to pickup a call using the button on the headset ).http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ZLLH22/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1',\n",

I wear it every day and it really holds a charge.  Some times it has not even  used enough battery to need a charge at the end of the day. I have not tested it on the weekend to see how long it would take to deplete the battery completely yet. This new one is a little tighter around the ear than my old one but I think it will loosen with time and is not too uncomfortable. Since my last one lasted for 4 or 5 years with everyday use I think they make a good product.',\n",

The doctor asked if he was a telephone operator, he said no, but... he was on conference calls 4 - 6 hours many days and was using a Plantronics CS55.  That headset is a bit heavy and digs into the ear a bit.  This was his email to me about this new one: &#34;Just wanted to let you know that this new headset is amazingly comfortable!  I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve put up with a sore ear for so long.  Thanks so much.&#34;He said the weight is more evenly distributed around the ear.This is being used with a Cisco IP Phone 7960 series and the cable to take it directly into the headset jack.  The configuration switch on the base needed to be changed to &#34;D&#34; and the &#34;Speaking Volume Dial&#34; turned down from 3 to 1.  The 3 setting caused echo in the headset speaker.',\n",

       " 'loved the older model of this but after a couple of years the band at the very top started to break and I was losing phone connections so I got this model  the new version operates just as the older model but with a major improvement in the base.  On the older model you had to check the light to ensure the headset made contact with the base to recharge it at the end of the day (several times I would come in the next morning and no charge)...on this model it will really only sit in it one way and &#34;clicks&#34; into place to ensure a good connection with the base charger.  The range is also a little better than on my previous model...can get a little farther down the hall on this one than I could on the older one.',\n",

I can do whatever I'm doing with my hands and when I received a phone call I just touch a button at my ear and start talking. The quality is excellently made and most importantly, the clarity of my speech going out and their speech coming in couldn't be any better. I put the headset on when I get to work. Sometimes, I take a lunch break for 30 minutes, during which I will recharge it a little or I will work straight through from 8 AM to 5 PM and never take the Plantronics headset off and the battery is fine all day long. Would most definitely recommend you buying this one. I would know because I have a very close, hands on use on use for this as it stays on my ear about 45 hours a week.\",\n",

LEDs on base tell you status and I love that when I take the headset out of the stand it goes off automagically.\",\n",
       " 'This product has a much easier set-up than the previous model.  Once I got used to it, I like the over-the-ear headset.  Reasonable price; excellent delivery time.  I would recommend this product.',\n",
       " 'Works better than we expected!  I May look into purchaseing more units for other members that are in my office',\n",
       " 'As far as i am concerned, these are the best headsets on the market.  They are lightweight and very comfortable to wear all day.  The battery life is solid and allows me to go all day.  The mic is small and unobtrusive.  The sound quality is perfect...maybe better than my hand set (thanks to noise canceling technology).  You wont go wrong with this one!',\n",
       " \"Once I called the company and the tech talked me through the setup with our phone system, we were happy campers. I can answer the phone from the back of the office. I don't have to run to the front desk to answer. The reception is marvelous. The only thing it cannot do is make the first call.The Plantronics tech was a jewel of the highest rank. He was patient and helpful, and once he talked me through the setup, he repeated the directions so I could write them down and not forget anything when I set up the other two phones in the office. He was wonderful. Thank you, Plantronics, for hiring and training him. Wish I knew his name. He deserves a raise!!\",\n",
       " 'I purchased this head set for my home office. It has great noise cancelling and I never have to crank it up to a loud volume.',\n",
       " \"Works great I would recommend the Electronic Hook Switch - if your phone has this feature.One drawback with Pantronics CS530 when compared to an earlier version I owned before this one is that the CS530's headset battery dies a lot faster than the model I replaced.\",\n",
       " 'The headset was easy to set-up, battery life can last the whole day as long as you turn off the headset after each call.  The only issue I run into is the &#34;echo&#34; effect&#34; which is from my voice, the headset will change after a few seconds.  Outside of that it is comfortable with my glasses on.',\n",
       " 'I talk on the phone with clients about 4 hours out of the day, and need my hands free to work on the computer at the same time.  This unit works great - sound quality is awesome, range is great.  Highly recommend.  Only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the fit into the docking station to get the unit to charge is not as seamless as it should be - not really a huge problem, but you have to jostle it a bit to make sure the charge light comes on, or risk coming in to a dead phone the next morning.',\n",
       " \"Slick and light, really good range and you can hear well from it. The price was just right. The base is simple and small.My only two quirks with it are: if it's not set on the charger JUST RIGHT it wont click into the charger and will not charge properly. The best way to know is to make sure the bottom right green light turns on when you deposit it into the charger. As well, it will randomly go into dead-air but the person is still on the other line and can hear you- it will just do that randomly. These are annoying, but not bad enough to warrant a return :)\",\n",
       " 'I have had one of these on my desk for some time. When it was time to replace the headsets for my contact center management team, this is what I wanted for them. Great audio quality. Excellent range. Sturdy headset. Great battery life.',\n",
       " 'Use in conjunction with NEC SL1100 digital telephone to provide user with remote phone capability. I have to say I hate using Plantronics because their product pre-sales support is dreadful.',\n",
       " 'The range is astonishing compared to my old CS55.  Headset piece is a little bulky but more comfortable than the CS55 in my opinion.  So far I love the headset although the mute feature takes nearly 4 or 5 seconds to activate / deactivate using the - volumn button on the headset even though the manual indicates it should be 1.5 seconds.',\n",
       " 'I bought this for work and it sounds great.  only drawback is you can not put it on mute.  This is a problem especially if you are on a conference call and are walking around your house where there might be a dog barking or a dishwasher running! :)',\n",
       " 'Difficult to seat properly in the recharger',\n",
       " \"Once working, I like this headset a lot.  One problem was switching the earbud.  It comes with a generic ear pad attached but also includes 3 different sizes of pieces that actually fit in the ear.  According to the instructions, it should have been an easy twist to remove.  Not so, I spent 15-20 minutes trying various twists and finally had to have someone from our telecommunications office come up and make the switch.When I'm using it however, I like it a lot.  Comfortable and works well, and, other than the earbud, was relatively easy to set up with a great 800-number walk through.\",\n",
       " \"I've been buying plantronics for years, and love their product.  This is a great system, and the headset is surprisingly light and pretty comfortable.  I recommend it.\",\n",
       " 'Works well. Very pleased. Has a very nice range. Battery lasts quiet a long time in between charges. Well pleased',\n",
       " 'There are issues with feedback that comes and goes on my end of the line however the benefits outweigh the problem.',\n",
       " 'Works well. Came in good condition and worked with the old lifter that we had. Ear pieces may not apepal to everyone.',\n",
       " \"It fits well on the ear and didn't take long to charge before using.  It also was a good price.\",\n",
       " \"I love plantronics' devices! This wireless headset has noise cancelling technology, which is great for our office. The headset is very comfortable and it has switchable ear plugs so you can customize it to your ear. The only downside to the headset is that the part hooks to your ear is a little too big for my ear, so I have to readjust it about four times a day (which is not too inconvenient).\",\n",
       " 'Love it. Much better than being tethered. Light weight and easy to wear.  Economical as well. Pleased with the product. Battery life could be longer but i manage by charging over lunch.',\n",
       " \"What I Like:-Docking system makes this headset simple to use and keep charged-Can quickly take the headset off the dock and put in ear when the phone rings - don't have to wear it constantly-Great call quality on both ends-Good volume controls-Easy to set up, just plug-and-play-Good range - I can walk around the whole office on the phone (not that I really ever do)-Sleek look-Comfortable - comes with many ear-tips for a custom fit that's easy to swap-Simple but effective indicator lightsWhat I don't like:-Behind-the-ear piece is a tad bulky (though not terribly so)-I can't answer the phone away from my desk - you have to lift the physical receiver.  It would be nice if this could be integrated somehow, but it doesn't end up being a deal breaker in the end.\",\n",
       " 'Works well for office use...just cannot sync with cell phone.',\n",
       " \"Satisfied with everything EXCEPT the item description indicated the wireless headset could place answered calls on hold & doesn't..  For business purposes, we needed the item to have that ability.  I now have to research & find another wireless headset that does but by then won't be able to return this item.  IF YOU ARE A BUSINESS LOOKING FOR A WIRELESS HEADSET THAT CAN ANSWER & PLACE CALLS ON HOLD DON'T BUY THIS MODEL.\",\n",
       " 'This headset works very well.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the over the ear piece is large and I have to take my hearing aid off to have it sit comfortably on my ear.',\n",
       " 'This headset is everything I wanted, except I ordered a NEW one and received a used one. The packaging was open and there was fingerprints all over it before I even touched it. I could see them right out of the box. Also the ear pieces were fuzzy instead of brand new foam.',\n",
       " \"This is a good unit.  It is comfortable on my head and the sound quality is very good.  When I answer using the unit it automatically triggers the HL10 Handset Lifter to lift up and also to hang up when I hang up.One reviewer noted, and it happened to me, too, that the Bluetooth pairing for the cellphone doesn't seem to last; e.g., you have to pair the unit again and again.  After the first time, I didn't bother.  The quality of the bluetooth connection wasn't great, and I didn't want to bother with continually pairing.\",\n",
       " 'Although quite expensive, this headset seems to work pretty well. Callers have said voice is very clear, had no idea I was on a headset. Had it for a couple of weeks, so far so good :)',\n",
       " \"This headset seems to work well.  I have had it for about a month now.  Didn't realize until I got it that an extra cable was needed for our VoIP phones.  For the most part it is comfortable.  it came with 4 extra ear buds, 2 foam and to silicone, and different sizes.\"]"
